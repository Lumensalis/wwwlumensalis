We are a father (James) and son (Samuel) team who enjoy building and playing tabletop games, especially WarHammer 40k.  

We started a small business 3D printing tabletop terrain, primarily as a way to teach my (home schooled) son
 some business skills and give him a taste of what running a small business is like. 
  Also doesn't hurt that it defrays some of the cost of our gaming supplies. 
   Until recently (after Christmas, 2020) we only sold locally, primarily through our FLGS ( https://heroicgaming.net/ ) but unfortunately for us, they are going out of business. 
   Fortunately for the rest of you, this means we are going online, and will begin shipping our 3D printed terrain throughout the USA.  And my son gets to learn all kinds of fun stuff about building and maintaining websites, online brand marketing, customer service, ...

This website serves as both a home for our business, and a place to share things we've learned that might be useful to others in the hobby.  While we do hope to build an online 3D printing business that ends up profitable,  I (James) am also an avid fan of 3D printed terrain, and I'm quite happy sharing tips with people who want to buy licenses for the files (from the creators - we can't sell those) and print their own.



# What We Do

## Tips and tricks for tabletop makers


We've learned a lot over the years, and while we&#39;ve still got plenty to learn, we&#39;re
    sharing some of those lessons here.

> [!WARNING]
>  STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Of course, that&#39;s nothing new for almost everyone into tabletop gaming. Most fall under one of two
categories - those with a pile of unpainted or even unbuilt models they&#39;ve been meaning to finish, and
those who lie about everything being finished ...

Still, this is a VERY new site, so there might be a few rough edges. We&#39;ll be filling it out and
cleaning things up through the first quarter of 2021. Feedback and constructive criticism is welcomed and
encouraged.
