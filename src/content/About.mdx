# Lumensalis 

Lumensalis was born out of the convergence of several long held passions of 
mine, as an umbrella for a variety of my projects
related to 
  - DIY effects for tabletop gaming terrain, theater props, costumes, etc.
  - embedded software development
  - Lighting and LEDs.  _LOTS_ of LEDs...
  - 3D printing

## People
 
  James Fowler - that's me.  Other places you might find me
include [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfowler/),  
my (outdated) website for [Open Sea Consulting](https://openseaconsulting.com/),
using up oxygen around Marietta, Georgia, or lurking in various forums
 related to embedded development, 3D printing (especially gaming terrain), ...

## Goals

### Take the pain out of programming

  I enjoy creating __focused microcosms of accessible expression which allow 
"mere mortals" to intuitively specify desired behaviors for an interactive
system without needing a degree in software engineering__.  That's an admittedly
unwieldy description, but there are reasons why
this is hard to define - and hard to accomplish.  If you're interested in 
details, check out the [LCPF Design page](/Projects/LCPDesign).


### Writing interactive, real-time, real-world software.

I've done plenty of software design and development work on some very 
demanding high performance systems, particularly for automated trading.
But there's something extra special about systems that
physically interact with the world around us.  I'm a bit obsessed with "blinky bits".

Sure, building successful frameworks for hedge funds is rewarding (and
 not _just_ financially), but I don't do it for fun in my spare time. 
I'll probably still be tinkering with interactive embedded systems and robotics 
long after I'm retired.  Lumenalis is where I share my progress on 
personal projects I've released publicly.
