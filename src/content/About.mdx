# Lumensalis 

Lumensalis was created as an umbrella for a variety of projects
related to DIY effects for tabletop gaming terrain, theater props, costumes, etc.


# Motivation

Lumensalis was born out of the convergence of several long held passions of mine.

### Writing interactive, real-time, real-world software.
I've done plenty of software design and development work on some very 
demanding high performance systems, particularly for automated trading.
But there's something extra special about systems that
physically interact with the world around us.  I'm a bit obsessed with "blinky bits".

Sure, building successful frameworks for hedge funds is rewarding (and
 not _just_ financially), but I don't do it for fun in my spare time. 
I'll probably still be tinkering with interactive embedded systems and robotics 
long after I'm retired.

### Make it something anyone can do 
I enjoy creating __focused microcosms of accessible expression which allow 
"mere mortals" to intuitively specify desired behaviors for an interactive
system without needing a degree in software engineering__.  That's an admittedly
unwieldy description, but there are reasons why
this is hard to define - and hard to accomplish.  If you're interested in 
details, check out the [LCP Design page](/Projects/LCPDesign).
