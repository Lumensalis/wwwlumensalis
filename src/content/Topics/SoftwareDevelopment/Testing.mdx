 - Using junior people for testing may be reasonable If you build simple, low risk commodity products.
If you only have junior developers writing and maintaining test code for
 complex systems, you're not saving as much as you think.
  
  - If you don't have solid testing harnesses with good CI testing, you're wasting time

  - repeatable testing is important - friends don't let friends ship regressions

 

## Testing Challenges in Realtime(ish) systems
  
Unfortunately, some things are very hard to test properly.  This is 
especially true of reactive, real-time systems. Subtle changes of 
sequence and timing in external activity/inputs can change the execution path.  
Reactions which produce external outputs can cause feedback and ripple effects
in a real world deployment which simplistic testing might never trigger.



### Limits of Unit Tests
There are always _some_ things you can still test with traditional unit testing.  
Where it can be used, it should be.  

### Sequencing Sensitivity
Theoretically, a purely stateless system would be immune to sequencing 
related problems.  However that's only theory,  and most complex real-time
systems are anything but stateless (try implementing a stateless state-machine...).
