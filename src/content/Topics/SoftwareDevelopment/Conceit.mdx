# What is a "Conceit"?

This is a concept/pattern I've used for a long time.  There aren't any 
other patterns (that I'm aware of) which _quite_ the same thing, although some
come close.

A Conceit 
  - provides a specific set of benefits in exchange for accepting specific, explicitly imposed limitations or requirements
  - is a known tradeoff, often sacrifices some degree of flexibility
  - intentionally limits "behind the curtain" access - very black box
  - is "opinionated"

# English definitions

There was I time when I thought the word "conceit" had a (secondary) meaning 
very similar to my intent with this concept. In actuality I probably conflated
conceit with concede or concession, which are in many ways a better (but still
 imperfect) fit.  However, there _are_ some relevant definitions and historical uses 
 of conceit, such as 

  - a result of mental activity / an organizing theme or concept [^1]
  - That which is conceived, imagined, or formed in the mind; idea; thought; image; conception [^2]
  - Design; pattern [^2]
  - Something conceived in the mind; a notion, conceptionâ€¦ [^3]
  - A fanciful, ingenious, or witty expression, metaphor, turn of thought, etc.; a stylistic affectation [^3]
  - any elaborate, playful, or ingenious artistic device or concept [^3]
  - an often unconventional, logically complex, or surprising metaphor whose delights are more intellectual than sensual [^4]

Admittedly some of these uses are no longer in common use.  However, in this
particular case I find slightly ironic satisfaction in twisting things to my whimsy.
