I've tried to find the "perfect documentation system" many times over the years.
It's a quest for which I've intentionally rationed my efforts, to keep it from
becoming a major obsessive distraction from "real work".  But I consider good 
documentation to be extremely valuable, so I keep trying. I've tried a lot of different 
approaches.  None of them have been ideal, although some come much closer
than others.

The following items are my expectations for a  "perfect documentation system".
I've found systems which provide a good (sometimes excellent) solution for each of these.
A few can cover most of them.   Nothing really satisfies all of them.  I'm not 
certain _any_ system can perfectly satisfy all of them, as some combinations
introduce a bit of contradictory tension. This requires tradeoffs and compromise, 
which _at best_ will be based on intentional educated choices among the
available options.  Ideally, making the right choices will result in the optimum available system
 _for a specific project at that time_.

## Some Ingredients of a Perfect Documentation System

### Separation of concerns

Creating _and maintaining_ excellent documentation requires quite a bit of flexibility in terms of both
 authoring and rendering content.  The degree to which a system achieves this
 has a major impact on it's long term viability.
 
 Ideally, the "source" for documentation should be concerned
  - _primarily_ with enriching semantic content, with [extensible custom semantics](#semantic-tagging) for key domain-specific concepts
  - secondarily with [calling out explicit associations](#referencing) (links) to other content
    - although _most_ cross-referencing should be auto-generated
    - especially when using associations to custom sematic concepts as 
        opposed to links to a specific location in related content
  - _minimally_ with [formatting](#minimal-formatting), _especially_ for documentation source "embedded"
    in other files ( i.e. comments or docstrings in a Python file)

### DRY 

I endeavor to keep source code - both programming and documentation - as
[DRY](../Manifesto#dry) as reasonably possible.  However, uncompromising 
adherence to that ideal can become problematic in a documentation system -
it may be _possible_, but often imposes significant tradeoffs in
 other aspects of the system.  A _little_ flexibility here can go a long way.
 But only a little, it should still be _mostly_ DRY.


One specific desirable directly DRY bit for documentation source is a 
shorthand/abbreviation mechanism for frequently repeated 
domain/project specific bits - especially those that might change.
  - this is intentionally vague, but _some_ examples include
    - [global definitions](#global-definitions)
    - [semantic tagging](#semantic-tagging)
    - substitution text in meta-content, such as a relative base path for links to another section
    - all of which needs to be inheritable, i.e. use defined bits from higher/enclosing scopes

[^DryManifesto]: see the [Top three rules for maintainable complex systems](Manifesto#TriDRY) in my [Manifesto](Manifesto)

 
### Semantic Tagging

There should be a concise mechanism for tagging ontology, i.e. 
[semantic annotation](https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/semantic-annotation/)
to facilitate creation and use of an _external_ (relative to individual 
documentation source files) domain/project specific knowledge graph.  At a minimum,
this requires 
  - a concise syntax for identifying references to entities within the knowledge graph
    - _without knowing the location of the entity's definition_, only that it ought
      to have a system-unique definition somewhere
  - a syntax for defining ontology : entities types, including their attribute and potential relationship types
  - a syntax for defining taxonomy : entity instances, including actual attributes and relationships to other entities

For example, consider the concept "Project". 
    - In the context of this particular site and it's documentation,
       a "Project" is, well, a project in the regular sense of the word.
       But it _also_
      - has it's source code in one (or more) git repos
      - is primarily implemented in a specific language
      - may be related to other projects (as parents, children, peers, ...)
    - 
Therefore I would like to be able to
  - define the ontology necessary to capture these semantics
    - identify entity types
        - Project, repo, programming language, ...
    - identify relationships
        - Projects can be associated with 0..N repos, languages, ...
        - Repos have a primary origin URL, ...
    - with these potentially inheriting and refining definitions from higher levels
  - mark and annotate entities within the documentation

to capture 
    - [LCPF](/Projects/LCPF/LCPF)
      - is a Project
      - has a repo at https://gitlab.com/lumensalis/lumensaliscplib
      - is written in Python
    - [LCPPF](/Projects/LCPPF/LCPPF)
      - is written in C++
    - [LumenSalis.com](https://gitlab.com/lumensalis/wwwlumensalis) (this website)
      - is written in MDX and Typescript/Next.js
      - refers to all the other projects
    - LWUI (the Lumensalis WebUI)
      - is a sub-project of LCPPF
      - written in Typescript/Next.js
      
There are numerous existing approaches which already do some (or all) of this.
However, finding one that plays well with the _rest_ of the 
"Perfect Documentation System" isn't so easy.
  - creating the ontology "metadata" description
    - some existing solutions are limited in scope and can't fully support the desired semantic 
  tagging feature set
    - more advanced options (especially those based on XML schemas) can be
      extremely tedious without UI assistance
    - may require using a different format/syntax than most other documentation source
 - _using_ the ontology within documentation source
   - ideally is done with an editor with awareness of and full support for
     - the documentation source format 
     - the general file source format
       - example : documentation source is contained within comment blocks in a C++ source file
     - the knowledge graph ontology (i.e. entities types, ...) 
     - the knowledge graph taxonomy (i.e. entities, ...)
     - context sensitive auto-completion and warning/error indicators fully incorporating _all_ of the above

There are also many systems which can _partially_ annotate semantics
automatically, especially for API documentation using tools like Doxygen.

### Global Definitions

There should be a concise mechanism for establishing reusable aliases for 
documentation content.  For example, my current CircuitPython framework project is
 rather unimaginatively named the **Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework**, and
 referred to as the LCPF throughout the documentation.  Eventually I might come up with a better name.  
If and when I do, it would be preferable to have a simple way to specify 
a project wide alias to change the displayed representation of LCPF whenever 
it is used.  

Note that this is _not_ just a simple search and replace,  as it only impacts displayed text. 
For example, given the Markdown source
```MDX
as opposed to LCPF [device configuration](Projects/LCPF/Concepts/DeviceConfiguration)  ...
```
  - LCPF in `in the LCPF` would be replaced
  - LCPF in `[device configuration](Projects/LCPF/Concepts/DeviceConfiguration)` would NOT be replaced


### Locality

The source for documentation is often directly correlated with artifacts defined 
by other "source" forms, such as software code, electronic schematics, 
complex layered object/vector/mesh graphic formats, etc.  Several
factors become significantly impacted by locality, or the "distance" between
the source of the artifact and the source of it's documentation.  The greater the 
distance between the artifact source and the documentation source, the more 
challenging it becomes to keep the documentation up to date.

Various systems for ["documentation in the source code"](#self-documenting-code) 
provide excellent locality as the source for the code and documentation can be
adjacent in the same file.  Most of these  also introduce other benefits - and sometimes challenges - in a documentation system.

On the other hand, a requirement to keep document source in separate files
reduces locality. This may be mandated intentionally, perhaps by corporate
policy. Or it may be imposed by technical integration limitations do to binary source 
file formats, inflexible tools for source editing (especially with WYSIWYG
editors for graphical content), etc.  Separating artifact source
 and document source files into distinct locations
(directories, CMS systems, SCM repos, ...) further exacerbates the problem.

 
### Familiarity

Anything close to a "Perfect Documentation System" will have a learning curve 
for anyone needing to author documentation content.  This makes incorporating 
existing, widely used approaches or systems like advantageous. 

Consider perhaps the most widely used current approach for source documentation,  Markdown:
  - most developers already use it 
  - most IDEs and devOps pipelines already have some degree of support for it
  - github, gitlab, etc. automatically auto-format Markdown code
  - it's "just text" so it works everywhere
  - it's relatively easy to read "raw" without a formatted preview

There are many other potential syntaxes / formats for documentation source,
some (all?) of which are arguably better than Markdown in the wider context 
of a "Perfect Documentation System",  but Markdown gets an A+ for 
familiarity and tooling.


### Self documenting code [#self-documenting-code]

In theory, perfect code needs no documentation ... HOWEVER
    - code cannot be written perfectly in an imperfect language
    - AND there _are_ no perfect languages
    - THEREFORE "self documenting code", while itself being a Good Thing, can 
        almost always be improved with well written additional documentation

There are many systems for "self documenting code", such as 
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) and [Sphynx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) 
(both of which support C++, Python, and a variety of other languages ),
PyDoc,  [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/), ... 


They usually include 
  - prescribed techniques and syntax for including documentation source within
 the programming language source code
    - Typically embedded within comments 
    - often with domain specific markup for enhanced semantics, such as the
     ubiquitous `@param ...` for documenting parameter names
  - often augmented by analyzing the parsed AST surrounding or adjacent to 
  comment-embedded documentation to extract context (associated class, method, file, ...)
  - occasionally can extract further documentation relevant content from language 
   specific annotations/attributes/metadata
  - usually requires some post processing pass to extract the documentation content
   - although sometimes makes content directly available directly within the application without
     any need for additional processing, such as Python docstrings

  semantic content by parsing the source, augmented by additional descriptive
  documentation source (typically in comments, sometimes in various language 
  specific annotation/attribute/metatdata extension syntax such as python docstrings  )

 ### Minimal formatting in content [#minimal-formatting]
 
 Documentation source should only minimally concerned with formatting.  The more specific the
formatting in the source, the more challenging it becomes to render the documentation in a high quality form

Simple formatting concepts like a Markdown-ish `_emphasize this_` _seem_ reasonable, but even 
these can quickly become problematic.  For example, if mentioning the name of an
object type in documentation source, it "feels" _right_ to __identify__ the ___type___ 
in some ~~manner~~ which <sub>causes</sub> it to <sup>stand</sup> <ins>out</ins>[^inMarkdown]. 
 The problem here is that lacking a better alternative, those who author documentation
 part time as an adjunct to other primary responsibilities may indeed add some form of emphasis, 
 but it will almost inevitably become applied inconsistently.  Something like ```
 it "feels" right to identify the \<OurTypeConcept>type\</OurTypeConcept>```
 allows the semantics to be clearly and unambiguously specified in the documentation 
 source, while ensuring that anything marked `<OurTypeConcept>` will be
 formatted consistently throughout an entire rendered form of the documentation.
 Of course, it's not _quite_ that simple...

[^inMarkdown]: as Markdown source, this would be ` "feels" _right_ to __identify__ the ___type___ 
in some ~~manner~~ which <sub>causes</sub> it to <sup>stand</sup> <ins>out</ins>`

### Referencing

### Tooling

IDE integrations, plugins for dynamic rendering, ...  there is a significant
ecosystem out there of various frameworks, modules, extensions, plugins, etc...
for assisting with authoring, rendering, and deploying your documentation.

The _right_ ones can significantly improve the authoring experience, 
 particularly with solid support for
  - "syntax" (of the document source form) checking
  - intelligent link management / cross referencing
    - auto complete
    - _project wide_ automated bad link detection (i.e. 'lint' for your doc source links)
  - preview
  

### Intelligent indexing

  - Search indexing 
  - auto semantic linking

### Flexible Rendering

An ideal rendering system allows a common shared set of documentation source 
to be cleanly rendered to many different output formats, such as PDF, HTML, RTF, XML, ...
It also allows consistent theme/styling to be applied through the entire
 body of documentation, especially for domain or even project-specific semantics.  
 For example, you might want all `\<OurTypeConcept>` spans in bold with a
slightly larger font size and a highlighted background for HTML output, 
but have it in a bold italicized monospace font for a custom PDF output 
intended for printing handouts at a conference presentation where you want match the 
recommended stylistic conventions for that conference's proceedings.


### Temporal awareness

Documentation changes over time.   The ability to rerender documentation based
on the source as it existed at a point in the past is important.  At the
_very_ least, the ability to rerender documentation for prior version releases is critical.

This, along with other useful features like forks and branches, is more or less
"free" when documentation source resides in standard files with a text-based 
format simply by using a good SCM (typically **git**).  However, if your
documentation source is maintained in a CMS (for instance, WordPress) this 
might prove more challenging.

## Documentation approach for this site

I have been primarily using a mix of PyDoc style annotations and Markdown
within Python and C++ source for a while,  but Markdown is a bit limited -
especially for additional free-form documentation outside of program
source code (for example, the documentation content in these
pages on Lumensalis.com).

Part of the reason I'm overhauling this site is to experiment with MDX as 
a primary format for document content.  This includes identifying usability
issues.  For example, having a central DRY location to identifying project-specific 
definitions for terms - like MDX - so that it's use can be detected
and prettied up automatically instead of needing to manually 
add a markdown link `every time I mention [MDX](/terms#MDX)`.  It looks like
implementing this should be feasible with a combination of custom MDX 
components and post-processing.

MDX seems to be a significant improvement over vanilla Markdown, but there
are still some important things it doesn't do, especially in terms of 
custom semantics.  I could hack in some semantics support with custom
components, but since that wouldn't be part of the "core" MDX feature
set, they won't get any special treatment from MDX integrations like IDE
extensions.  That's unfortunate, because the widespread availability of MDX
tooling is one of it's major advantages.

There are other potential documentation source formats, such as 
[AsciiDoc](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/),
[DocBook](https://docbook.org/),
and [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText),
and even [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) have deeper support for
some features useful in software documentation, and provide extension
mechanisms for semantic tagging that aren't as removed from the core 
functionality.
