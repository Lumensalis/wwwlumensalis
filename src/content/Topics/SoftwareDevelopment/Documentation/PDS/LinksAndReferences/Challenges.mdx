# Challenges for Links and References


A significant body of documentation will rarely have all of the
documentation source in a single location or format.  However,
it is sometimes desirable to embed links to other locations in the 
combined documentation which are defined outside a local project.  There 
needs to be a consistent and predictable form for such external links.

## Domain Hierarchy

Rendering documentation 

## reference content

### reference format

There needs to be _some_ way to embed links in documentation source.  The common
`[text](location)` format for links might be a place to start.  However, 
there needs to be a way to distinguish between local references 

### NO LOCATION

This form needs a way to encode links relative to the overall domain semantics
__without__ actual location.  Common mechanism such as 
  - URLs into another repo
  - relative file system links outside the local project 
  - any other technique that includes information about _where_ the 
    referenced content resides
can be expedient and workable for simple bodies of documentation.




## Variables 

 - multiple content locations
   - directly authored files ( .mdx / .asciidoc / ... )
   - extracted from other file formats (C++|Python with Doxygen|Sphinx, JSDoc, ...)
   - potentially across multiple repos

 - variations in link/reference syntax in documentation source flavors
