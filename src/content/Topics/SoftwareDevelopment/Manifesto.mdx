title: Software Engineering Manifesto
---

This is a loose collection of maxims and aphorisms I've developed over the years.

## Immutable Truths
  - Perfect choices rarely exist in complex systems
  - A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but not all consistency is foolish
  
## Performance / Optimization
  - Zeroth law of optimization : It doesn’t matter how fast you can get the wrong answer
  - You can’t improve what you can’t measure

## Quality
  - Top three rules for maintainable complex systems 
    - Don’t repeat yourself
    - Don’t repeat yourself
    - Don’t repeat yourself

## Testing
  - Everything you build will get tested - the only question is when and by whom.  Clients and customers are quite adept at finding whatever you missed.
  - Using junior people for testing may be reasonable If you build simple, low risk commodity products.   If you want to reach the moon, test with your best.
  - If you have to fix something twice, you’re doing it wrong.
  - Provenance matters.

## Documentation
  - Perfectly written code doesn't need Documentation
    - HOWEVER, code cannot be written perfectly in an imperfect language
    - AND there _are_ no perfect languages
    - THEREFORE "self documenting code", while itself being a Good Thing, can 
       usually be improved with well written additional documentation
