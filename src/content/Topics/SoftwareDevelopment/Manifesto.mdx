## How Things Should Be Done

The following contains concepts and principles which I believe to be
fundamental requirements for designing and implementing "good" 
complex systems.   It is by no means an exhaustive list.  I still have 
a good bit of [editing](#short-is-sweet) left to do.  But it offers some insight 
into my perspective on what matters in software development.

### Exceptions to every rule

These can be read as applied as "rules", and doing so may produce optimal
results in most cases.  However, no rule works as intended everywhere. 
IMHO ___there are no perfect rules|principles|methodologies|programming
languages|etc___ for developing complex systems.  Those who insist otherwise
just haven't hit the limits of their sacred cows yet.  Those who know better 
retain an open mind, and stay willing to consider new ideas, adapt
accordingly, and keep learning.  

## Original Tidbits

This section a loose collection of maxims and aphorisms I've developed over the years...

### Performance / Optimization

>  Zeroth law of optimization : It doesn’t matter how fast you can get the wrong answer

>  <span id="cantimprove">You can’t improve what you can’t measure</span>

### Reliability in Complex Systems

> <span id="TriDRY">Top three rules for maintainable complex systems</span>  
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t repeat yourself  
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t repeat yourself  
>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t repeat yourself  

> <span id="FoolishConsistency">A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but not all consistency is foolish</span>

> Provenance matters

### Testing
  
> Everything you build will get tested - the only question is when and by whom.  
> Clients and customers are quite adept at finding whatever you missed.

> If you want to reach the moon, test with your best.

> If you have to fix something twice, you’re doing it wrong.

> Friends don't let friends ship regressions

## Adopted Precepts

Concepts I generally endorse, although without the witty phrasing

### Balance and Harmony

All these are beliefs _I_ hold strongly.  I don't insist that others do - I've
often worked talented people I sincerely respect who think quite differently 
on a few of these.  There's nothing on this list I consider immutable -
other than _perhaps_ "exceptions to every rule". Maybe.

OTOH if you refuse to discuss or consider dissenting opinions you're dealing 
with dogma, not science or engineering.  That said, questioning is good and
should be _encouraged_(although there are some reasonable caveats).


### Complexity and Compromise

ALL complex systems must deal with uncertainty (even the awful ones  - typically by
crashing) and typically juggle a formidable list of requirements.  Consider
 the "Good, Fast, Cheap" cliche - simple (at least on the surface) but
virtually impossible to pull off in practice.  The requirements for complex 
projects will inexorably contain a few desirable deliverables which are
mutually exclusive or simply out of reach.  They must build upon a
collection of decisions related to tradeoffs concerning these requirements (representable by a 
[DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) if you're
really lucky).  

But invariably, whether you blame Murphy, 
the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle), 
[TNSTAAFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch),
or the whims of fate, the chances of finding a decision set that _completely_ 
satisfies _all_ the requirements for a complex system may deal in probabilities on the scale
of rolling dice until the heat death of the universe.

For example, I never encourage violating [DRY](#DRY), but there are legitimate cases 
where I have (and would again).  Sometimes disparate toolchains prevent simple
sharing, and development of custom DevOps integration to stay DRY _reliably_ 
wouldn't be cost effective.  Some forms of code sharing may breach regulatory 
or security requirements regarding isolation between development groups
responsible for different areas.


Perhaps you disagree with me - in fact, I suspect I might agree with 
some disagreements. For example, we may have significantly different 
definitions of what constitutes a "complex system" (even without
contradicting any of the above).  Or you may object that nothing 
unattainable should be in the requirements in the first place.[^unattainable]
This could lead to a plausible scenario in which one _might_ achieve a
 "perfect decision set" without winning the cosmic lottery.  

[^unattainable]: A valid objection in the beginning.  However, requirements _evolve_ and - 
especially for complex systems - sometimes come to include the impossible (at 
least to the extent of "we have no idea how to pull that off").  That 
doesn't mean you must give up, but it _does_ mean figuring out where to
compromise and what to prioritize to get the best result possible.

And yet, doing so reinforces the primary premise, which is that
_there are no perfect rules_.  We simply lack the means to
comprehensively and unambiguously define rules and requirements with
absolute clarity and no chance of misunderstanding.  Chaos and uncertainty
are intrinsic, transcendent, and unavoidable.  There will _always_ be exceptions.

So embrace the chaos.  Learn to love tradeoffs - they can be a positive 
source of differentiation if you can find a better decision set than the 
competition.  Accepting compromise doesn't always mean you failed, and it _can_ mean
you're on the right track towards success the inflexible can never reach.


### DRY

I'm rather [fanatical](#TriDRY) about the value of the 
[DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)(Don't Repeat Yourself).
I consider anything that violates it to be _at best_ a source of technical debt.
It almost invariably increases risks within the the system[^dryRisks].
It also often becomes a major constraint on the ability to scale the complexity 
of larger systems.

[^dryRisks]: This _can_ be mitigated with robust - often custom - DevOps 
tooling in cases were such duplication can be provably "correct", therefore 
initial mismatches (typically typos) or incomplete synchronization on changes
 can be caught in the
[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) process.  With this in place, handling
each duplication still adds requires additional coding effort, but at least the risk
of silently introducing flaws by failing to keep multiple source locations
synchronized is dramatically reduced.

### Short is Sweet

> Brevity is the soul of wit

> I have only made this letter longer, because I have not had the time to make it shorter[^letterLonger]

[^letterLonger]: Blaise Pascal  https://wist.info/pascal-blaise/10466/_

All else being equal, shorter is _usually_ better.   There are exceptions, particularly with [naming](#readablecode).
But expressing all that you need to express (whether in prose or code) in it's
most concise form takes effort, and usually some time to edit and reflect.

If your reading this document (and many of the others on this site) in the early
summer of 2025, it should be a good example.  It (or at least the existing 
content will be refined and condensed) _will_ get smaller before long.

I've observed a similar dynamic with source code.  Some of the _best_ code 
actually gets smaller over time, while _increasing_ in flexibility,
reliability, and performance.  However there is an additional dynamic in play, 
beyond the extra work required for concise prose.  With code, there's often 
a lot you don't know ( interactions and use cases in practice, performance, 
...) until you've gotten the first cut up and running.  Intentional observation 
and analysis over time can reveal hidden correlations and inspire better ideas.  
After which _judicious_ refactoring can result in quantifiable improvements in capability 
and performance _and_ a reduction in size and complexity (especially in interfaces).


### Documentation matters

  This is important enough to have it's [own page](WritingDocumentation)
  
### Testing matters

    Also worthy of it's [own page](Testing)

### Interface trumps Implementation

Yet another worthy of it's own page, which will be coming soon.  
A few highlights:



A quick & dirty subsystem implementation behind a well designed interface can dramatically improve development velocity 
without adding excessive risk.

A _perfect_ implementation with a poorly designed interface is a recipe for disaster.

or...
```math
cost:[ interfaceQuality, implementationQuality ]\to TechnicalDebt
\atop
cost( "badInterface","goodImplementation ") = 10 * cost( "goodInterface","badImplementation ")
```

### Write Readable Code [#readablecode]

Amateur and junior developers (and even a few brilliant seasoned ones) may 
see writing code as a way to show how clever they are.  Or be obsessed with 
code formatting (making it as compact as possible or mind-numbingly dispersed), 
or employing the latest flavor-of-the-month syntactic sugar every change 
they get.

Older, wiser, experienced types have had to _read_ far more code than they've
_written_, which instills an appreciation for the value of readable code.  In
many cases, readability of the code is arguably more important to the
success of a project than more commonly sought "priorities" such as
performance optimization (especially outside the fast path - you
_did_ [identify your fast path](#cantimprove) first, right?). 

There are many ways to improve the readability of your code, some of which are
language specific. Someday I'll write more on that.  For now, I'll offer a few
simple and near universally applicable tips.

  - Names matter. 
    - <code lang='cpp'>void DontFearDescriptiveNames( int onTheOtherHandYouCanTakeThisToFar );</code>
  - Coding style matters
    - _which_ coding style you use - how you manage indenting code blocks, 
      whether you use camelCase or under_scores, etc is ultimately not that 
      significant
    - what _is_ significant is picking a style and using it consistently



### “Simple things should be simple, Complex things should be possible” [#simplethings]
  - Attributed to Alan Key, see [Alan Kay’s Approach to Accessible Complexity](https://medium.com/@mdelhaous/alan-kays-approach-to-accessible-complexity-4e3b6610cf60)
  - Back when C++ was young and Rogue Wave was a major player, there was an oft 
    repeated mantra which went something like "Make simple things easy, 
    and hard things possible".  While researching it's origin to see if that
    might have been an original saying (we had some very bright bulbs in 
    those days) I found the Alan Keys quote, from which it was
    almost certainly paraphrased.  

### Successfully employing a methodology is more than following checklists
  
I've more than once butted heads with well-meaning Agile fanboys who 
insisted on dogmatic application of commonly Agile-associated buzzwords [^notAgile]
like YAGNI[^YAGNI][^notAgile] and MVP[^MVP].  Somehow they simultaneously
_missed_ the significant role of communicating customers and understanding 
their needs in the Agile methodology[^isAgile]
       
Obviously, implementing features you don't need yet is usually a **bad** 
thing.  Best case, it's an opportunity cost -and that's only if you actually
get it right _and_ it proves useful over time.

However, designing interfaces/APIs which _accommodate_ (but not implement)
known, rational future requirements _can_ be **good**.  Rejecting such from
knee-jerk adherence to YAGNI/MVP dogma is... **not**.  

And citing YAGNI/MVP as a justification to avoid the up front work necessary 
to provide a DRY interface wrapper around high risk business critical features - 
for example,  making sure all financial transactions against against the ledger
_holding the account of record_ is centralized, secured, and thoroughly tested -
is a waste of time because copy&paste reuse of SQL code _which modifies 
the ledger_ "is quicker and easier" and "we should be Agile" and "we're stuck
with junior developers" and "you're over-engineering things" - _in an application
for PCI compliant payment processing_[^ledger]...  Ok, deep breath, 
dismounting soapbox, putting that pet peeve back on the shelf.

This demonstrates some of the challenges of maintaining balance.  Names were
omitted and some details changed to protect the innocent (I never _proved_
them guilty) but needless to say these were inspired by actual experience, 
in which I _strongly_ disagreed with other some other architects.  And yet 
their motivation wasn't wrong.  YAGNI[^YAGNI] and MVP[^MVP] are both
reasonable and valuable principles to employ in the design/development cycle. 

Ultimately, ongoing disagreement between leads and high level team members can cause more 
damage than simple choosing _either_ option.  Sometimes you just gotta agree 
to disagree, and if you can still achieve consensus and present a unified front[^unified] 
then you've found balance.  If you can't, maybe it's time to move on. 


[^unified]: which means compromise for at least one - maybe all - of the parties involved
[^YAGNI]: An [Extreme Programming practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) which strongly discourages adding functionality before you need it
[^MVP]: [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
[^notAgile]: which, interestingly enough, are not actually part of the core Agile values and principles
[^isAgile]: which very much ARE parts of the core Agile values and principles


---

[^ledger]:  If you ever read this - you know who you are - I still believe 
    you're a bright, experienced, and talented developer, I sincerely hope all that 
    copypasta reuse never blew up in your face, and I suspect you've 
    _probably_ gotten away with it and managed to put a more robust solution
    in place by now.  But I could not and will 
    not ever endorse taking shortcuts incurring that degree of risk in a financial 
    application.  If I had built
    trading systems that way they would have all crashed and gone 
    bankrupt within months.
  


# Notable Mentions

### [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)

I somehow missed out on this - guess that can happen if you spend more time 
actually building stuff instead of playing buzzword bingo and figuring out 
what new hotness you can leverage for FUD to get more consulting clients by
convincing them they need to rebuild everything from scratch (looking at
you, Y2K and Y2K era Java "Enterprise" apps...).   I only recently encounteed 
it when researching the origin of [Simple things should be...](#simplethings) -
which is a shame, because what little I've seen so far has quite a bit in common
with some of the design decisions in my current projects like 
the [LCPF](/Projects/LCPF/LCPF)
