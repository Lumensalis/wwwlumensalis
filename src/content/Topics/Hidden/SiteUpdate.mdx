History of major site updates

## Spring 2025

Improving documentation content (partly as an experiment related to finding 
[better ways to manage software documentation](Topics/SoftwareDevelopment/WritingDocumentation)).
  
  - Convert and consolidate various bits and pieces (static HTML, WordPress, Wiki,
      Markdown, ...) to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
  - Rewrite site home page / structure using
    - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - rather major overkill for now, but...
       - I've already used it in other projects, so I know I _could_ incorporate 
         some pretty slick features in the future with WebSockets,
         [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/), [Three.js](), ...
       - If Lumensalis explodes in popularity (not likely, the current simple
         hosting model would probably suffice even with wide adoption within
         the current community of people building effects, but we can hope) 
         it's mostly ready to deploy on a more scalable modern [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)
    - [Nextra](https://nextra.site/)
      - Lightweight framework/template integrating MDX support for Next.js
      - looks like best balance between ease of startup and features compared to other options like
        - [AriaDocs](https://vercel.com/templates/documentation/documentation-template)
        - Direct MDX integration into an existing Next.js projects
           - plenty of [guides](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/mdx) [on](https://dev.to/nitinfab/getting-started-with-mdx-in-nextjs-a-practical-guide-30hf)
             [how](https://www.dhiwise.com/post/comprehensive-guide-to-using-next-mdx-remote-in-nextjs) [to](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/advanced-content-creation-mdx-next-js-14)
            [do](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs/mdx-in-next-js/) [this](https://spacejelly.dev/posts/mdx-in-nextjs) 
           - but leaves you dealing with the outer navbar / TOC / banner / footer layout, search indexing, ...
        - not a huge lock-in risk since most of the work is in the MDX
          content, which should work without modification even if the mechanism
          for integrating MDX changes
    - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
      - I really, really like TypeScript.  I've used javascript off and on 
        over the years, especially for interactive 
        realtime(ish) client/browser trading system UIs.  However, I found it rather
        frustrating to write reliable async code with complex data content 
        because of how syntactically subtle bugs could be, especially with
        the lack of feedback (silent errors).  When I started using Next.js, 
        it lead me to try TypeScript and it dramatically changed my willingness
        to work with Javascript-based components.


## 2020

Initial site creation as simple static site as a basic HTML overview with 
the majority of more complex content in Wiki, WordPress, and links to 
GitHub/GitLab markdown pages.
