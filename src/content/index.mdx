[^1]: There are several [reasons for the update](Topics/Hidden/SiteUpdate), 
the most significant being conversion to a [more effective and scalable method
for organizing and deploying documentation](Topics/SoftwareDevelopment/Documentation/WritingDocumentation) 
based on  [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 

## Overview

Lumensalis is focused on helping makers, gamers, and hobbyists add interactive 
effects to their projects without having to spend years learning to program. 
If you're ready to ***light up your table***, you're in the right place.
We recently released the [Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework](Projects/LCPF), 
which aims to help hobbyists make their creations shake, sing, and shine.

If you'd like to read my pontifications on software development, my 
[Software Manifesto](Topics/SoftwareDevelopment/Manifesto) is a good place to start.

## Examples

We're working on a video collage demonstrating the kinds of effects you can 
achieve using our latest project, the [Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework](Projects/LCPF).  For now, here's a collection of 
video snips from older projects:
