[^1]: There are several [reasons for the update](Topics/Hidden/SiteUpdate), 
the most significant being conversion to a [more effective and scalable method
for organizing and deploying documentation](Topics/SoftwareDevelopment/Documentation/WritingDocumentation) 
based on  [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 

## Overview

Lumensalis is focused on helping makers, gamers, and hobbyists add interactive 
effects to their projects without having to spend years learning to program. 
  If you're a gamer ready to
 ***Light Up Your Table***[^lightTable],  in need of custom illuminated theater props, 
wanting a bit more dazzle for your cosplay,  or simply obsessed with lighting things up like we are, you're in the right place.
We recently released the [Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework](Projects/LCPF), 
which aims to help hobbyists make their creations shake, sing, and _especially_ shine.

[^lightTable]: The name "Lumensalis" came from a mashup of the latin words __lumen__([light](https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/noun/239/)),
__mensalis__([table](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mensalis)), and __salis__([salt or wit](https://latin-dictionary.net/definition/33925/sal-salis)).
While this not _real_ latin, several possible interpretations are quite relevant
to the goals of this project. For example, "lighting up your table", "adding flavor with light", "inventive lighting", ...

## Examples

We're working on a video collage demonstrating the kinds of effects you can 
achieve using our latest project, the [Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework](Projects/LCPF).  For now, here's a collection of 
video snips from older projects:
