## Project History

This project began shortly after I started working with CircuitPython in March 2025.   
I wanted to integrate support for various 
[TerrainTronics](https://terraintronics) Castle "shields" attached to an 
ESP32 [S2 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html),  which I 
already supported in my (still unreleased) C++ effects firmware.  

Getting the TerrainTronics hardware working under CircuitPython - at level 
to a level similar to most CircuitPython support - was fairly straightforward.
However it quickly became apparent that while - as expected - Python made
_some_ things much easier than C++, there were still challenges.  Nothing a
developer with serious async & real-time(ish) experience can't handle, but 
that still leaves a daunting task even for many "professional" developers, 
and effectively disqualifies non-programmers altogether.

Perhaps the biggest hurdle is that most interesting effects have significant 
temporal aspects - things change over time.  Conceptually, this is something 
most people can understand quite intuitively, but to break it down into code
in a programming language can be surprisingly challenging. [^1]
 Programming reactive systems which support complex 
temporal behaviors isn't a common task, and it isn't easy.  

There are techniques such as event-driven and async/promise/future frameworks, 
but those aren't exactly beginner friendly. The LCPF seeks to use an alternate 
approach which - hopefully - will avoid these issues and let just about anyone
use complex effects.

[^1]: For example : Just about  anyone can pick up a pencil and draw a
 curve freehand.   Fewer remember enough trigonometry to describe the curve 
 mathematically. Fewer still can translate the math into code which renders 
 a curve - especially if you want variable stroke width, anti-aliasing,
 alpha/transparency support, color gradients...   Even so, all this can
 still be broken down into a fairly traditional set of sequential 
 instructions which can be easily expressed in any modern programming 
 language.  Adding a temporal requirement, such as animating the rendering of
  the curve or making it's vis, can make it significantly more challenging.
