## Key Concepts

There are a few fundamental concepts used in the LCPF 

### Inputs

Think of inputs like senses - taste, touch, sight, hearing... they are 
channels of incoming information about the environment in which your 
project operates.  Practical examples include
  - Switches and buttons
  - positional sensors - like volume knobs
  - proximity/distance sensors
  - light sensors
  - IR/RF remote controls

Inputs are often, but not always, associated with a physical electronic 
component.  LCPF also supports "virtual" inputs such as
  - DMX (Art-Net) device emulation
  - Web page controls [^2]
  - Mesh connections to other LCPF projects [^3]

### Outputs

Outputs are things that can create change in the environment.   Practical examples include
  - LEDs and other light producing devices
  - Audio output
  - Motion / motor control

### Device configuration

In order to use all the nifty hardware that provides Inputs and/or Outputs, 
LCPF needs to know what hardware you are using.  This is handled through 
device configuration, more details on the [device configuration page](./DeviceConfiguration.mdx)
