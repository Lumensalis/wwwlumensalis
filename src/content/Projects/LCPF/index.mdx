# Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework

The LCPF is designed to help non-programmers incorporate interesting and
complex effects into their projects.  It doesn't completely eliminate the
need to do a little "coding", but it makes it much easier[^1].  

The LCPF is not as powerful as, nor is it a replacement for,
 my [C++ firmware](../LCPPF).  However, it
  - uses many similar concepts
  - is easier to get started
    - more "new user" documentation and examples
    - simpler hardware configuration
    - convenient workflow options
  - is available now (my C++ firmware has yet to be publicly released)

There are a few fundamental concepts used in the LCPF 

### Inputs

Think of inputs like senses - taste, touch, sight, hearing... they are 
channels of incoming information about the environment in which your 
project operates.  Practical examples include
  - Switches and buttons
  - positional sensors - like volume knobs
  - proximity/distance sensors
  - light sensors
  - IR/RF remote controls

Inputs are often, but not always, associated with a physical electronic 
component.  LCPF also supports "virtual" inputs such as
  - DMX (Art-Net) device emulation
  - Web page controls [^2]
  - Mesh connections to other LCPF projects [^3]


### Outputs

Outputs are things that can create change in the environment.   Practical examples include
  - LEDs and other light producing devices
  - Audio output
  - Motion / motor control

### Device configuration

In order to use all the nifty hardware that provides Inputs and/or Outputs, 
LCPF needs to know what hardware you are using.  This is usually a fairly
complex part of an embedded project - LCPF can makes this much easier[^5].  For example, if you
use a [Lolin S2 Mini](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/s2/s2_mini.html) with a 
[Terrain-Tronics Caernarfon Castle Kit](https://www.tindie.com/products/terraintronics/caernarfon-castle-kit/), 
 IR remote,  35 NeoPixel LEDS, and two servo motors,  your entire code for device configuration could be
as simple as 
```python 
    caernarfon = mainManager.TerrainTronics.addCaernarfon(neoPixelCount=35)
    doorMotor = caernarfon.initServo( 1, "doorDrive" )
    windowMotor = caernarfon.initServo( 2, "windowMotor" )
    remote = caernarfon.addIrRemote()
```
No pins assignments, no addresses, no board types - LCPF handles all that for you.[^5]

[^1]: Well, hopefully, assuming I get things right...
[^2]: Partially implemented
[^3]: Not implemented yet, but coming soon
[^3]: Currently supported controllers include Lolin S2 Mini, Lolin S3 Mini, and the Lilygo T-OI Plus
[^5]: _IF_ you  stick within the "curated" set of hardware options.  However, there are already a few dozen supported devices and the list continues to grow.
