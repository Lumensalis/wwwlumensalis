# Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework

## Overview

The LCPF is designed to help non-programmers incorporate interesting and
complex effects into their projects.  It doesn't completely eliminate the
need to do a little "coding", but it makes it much easier[^1].  

The LCPF is not as powerful as, nor is it a replacement for,
 my [C++ firmware](../LCPPF).  However, it
  - uses many similar concepts
  - is available now (my C++ firmware has yet to be publicly released)
    - <Image src="/images/gitlab-logo-500.png#left" alt="GitLab Logo" width={49} height={49} /> [LCPF repo](https://gitlab.com/lumensalis/terraintronicscp) on Gitlab
  - is easier to get started
    - more "new user" documentation and examples
    - simpler hardware configuration
    - convenient workflow options

If you're interested in working with the LCPF,  the best way to get started
