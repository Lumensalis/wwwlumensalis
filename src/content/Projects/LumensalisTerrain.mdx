title: Lumensalis Terrain
---

We started Lumensalis Terrain, a small business 3D printing tabletop terrain, primarily as a 
way to teach my (home schooled) son some business skills and give him a 
taste of what running a small business is like.  Also didn't hurt that it
helped defray some of the cost of our gaming supplies.

We only sold locally, primarily through our
 [FLGS](https://islaythedragon.com/guides/guide-to-gaming-the-flgs) ( Heroic Gaming ).
Unfortunately they went out of business during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since 
then we've considered opening on online store but have yet to do so.   We are 
open to commissions (and have licenses for commercial printing) if you 
need some WarLayer (including compatible sets like Skrap Landz) or 
Dragon's Rest terrain printed.
