## Goals 
 ___Create a focused microcosm of accessible expression which allow 
"mere mortals" to intuitively specify desired behaviors for an interactive
system without needing a degree in software engineering___ 

 That's an admittedly unwieldy description, but there are reasons why
this is hard to define - and hard to accomplish.

  - Intuitive : needs to "make sense" to non-developers
    - present an environment in which they can specify desired behaviors
    - Always start from the perspective of a non-programmer.
      - DON'T start by thinking about code/logic for the _implementation_ of behaviors
      - DO think about how one might intuitively describe the desired behaviors
    - Clarity of the "behavior specifications" is _extremely_ important
      - far more than performance
  - Interactive
    - Cause/effect, action/reaction, ...
    - non blocking, no traditional sequential/linear coding
  - Temporal awareness
    - many interesting and desirable behaviors boil down to a change over time.
      - this can be very challenging to implement reliably and scalably unless 
         support is built in at a fundamental level
  - Topical
    - key domain-specific concepts must have 
  - Distinct conceptual separation between specifying hardware configurations and desired behaviors


## What this IS and is NOT

I'll eventually add a section on the various requirements, tradeoffs, and methodologies 
which have influenced my ideas on how to make this work over the years.  But
for the programmer geeks out there, let me clarify that this is NOT a 
[state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine),
[DSL (Domain Specific Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language),
[event-driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)/[async](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_method_invocation)/[futures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) framework,
[pattern language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language),
or a set of [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern), 
although it may (and in practice does) incorporate many of these internally.


## An Example Use Case
Just for fun, here's a use case which helps illustrate some of the challenges.  
Say you want to motorize a door in a piece of terrain.

  - Givens 
    - There is a door which you want to be able to open and close
    - There is a motor attached to a mechanical mechanism, which is causes the door to move as the motor rotates
  - Necessary behaviors
    - open the door
    - close the door
    - move door to a partially open position
    - vary the speed at which the door moves
    - interrupt (pause or stop and cancel) or change speed of any current movement
    - specify other behaviors triggered by door movement 
  - Complications
    - there are several types of motors (DC, servo, stepper, ...) 
    - there is rarely a simple, foolproof way of knowing the door's position (between closed and open)
      - absolute encoder is ideal, but also rare (and often overkill)
      - servo motors have a degree of "absolute" target
      - limit switches can detect the door at a specific position (open/closed/...)
        - continuing to drive the motor past physical limits (i.e. the door frame 
            prevent's further movement in the "close" direction past the "closed" position ) 
            can potentially cause damage to mechanical parts and electronics
        - some doors will only have one limit switch (typically open OR closed), some will have none
    - all logic/implementation code MUST be non-blocking
    - minimize risk of "letting the smoke out"
      - failsafe time limits to keep the motor from running indefinitely are highly desirable
        - even _with_ limit switches and an absolute encoder,  parts can fail, wires can break, ...


First, consider just how complicated it gets to support _all_ of the 
"necessary behaviors" even with fancy modern async frameworks.  Now, what
kind of grammar could you construct that allows a non-programmer to clearly
and comprehensively articulate that desired behavior?
