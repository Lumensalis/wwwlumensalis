# Lumensalis CircuitPython Framework



## Why CircuitPython - a developer's perspective

While I've been working with Python and developing embedded systems in C++ 
for a long time, I didn't get around to trying Python for embedded systems 
until March of 2025.  That's when I started experimenting with CircuitPython, 
and began building a framework for defining effects behaviors using concepts 
similar to those in my C++ firmware projects.
